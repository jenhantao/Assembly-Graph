*** REVIEW FORM ID: 1002789::537701
*** SUBMISSION NUMBER: 2
*** TITLE: Integrating Synthetic Gene Assembly and Site-Specific Recombination Cloning
*** AUTHORS: Bianca Lam, Frederico Katzen, Kevin Clancy, Kimberly Wong, Todd Peterson and Antje Taliana
*** PC MEMBER: Leonidas Bleris
--------------------------------------------------------------
*** REVIEW:
---  Please provide a detailed review, including justification for
---  your scores. This review will be sent to the authors unless
---  the PC chairs decide not to do so. This field is required.

This abstract describes an in vitro assembly work flow for constructing full length genes from synthetic fragments. The general strategy includes two PCR steps in which fragments have homologous ends to anneal to one another at overlapping points. The authors report the assembly of 44 7-27 kb genes from 444 fragments and a 25 percent or better outcome for correct sequence of the final clones. 

A few points remain unclear. Specifically, where it is said that "With computer-aided design of cloning strategies and screening of assembled genes, automation, and a LIMS for sample tracking, we aim to increase the efficiency and robustness of this synthetic gene assembly workflow", the use of CAD and LIMS is not described in detail. It is also not clear how assembled genes can "be site specifically recombined to make multiple expression plasmids containing different elements and/or tags". More elaboration on this would have been helpful.
